# README

`transcript_marker` combines a transcript exported from [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) as text with an outline generated by [Creators Best Friend](https://www.intelligentassistance.com/creator-s-best-friend.html), a free extension for [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) that exports timecodes from markers.

The combined output has the two features:

1. Headings placed at appropriate times in the transcript
1. A linked table of contents at the top of the file that lets you jump to specific parts of the transcript

You can see an example of this [here](https://audrow-nash-podcast.github.io/transcripts/1-rethinking-robotics-electric-sheep-s-journey-to-safer-smarter-machines.html).

Once you have this, you should be able to run this program from you command line by typing `transcript_marker`.
